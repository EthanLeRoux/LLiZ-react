                    Welcome to Let's Learn isiZulu, a site dedicated to the learning of the isiZulu language, and the
                    Zulu Culture.
                </p>

                <h2>About Me!</h2>

                <p>
                    Who am I? I'm Ethan, born and raised in in Cape Town, South Africa.I started learning Japanese in
                    2019,and up
                    to this point I can say I've learnt all without having to pay a single Rand(South Africa's national
                    currency,
                    to those who don't know), and after having been learning it for about 3 years as of writing this, I
                    figured
                    I'd get back to my roots and learn a language thats much closer to home, and it ended up being
                    isiZulu!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Why isiZulu? Well, originally I wanted to learn isiXhosa (another language spoken round these parts,
                    here's a wiki for those uninformed: <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_South_Africa">Languages of South Africa
                </a>), however I couldn't find any learning material/resources for isiXhosa that wasnt just common
                    phrases, old, over complicating noun
                    clauses or not explaining how to construct simple sentences. But it is understandable, these
                    langauges dont have huge communities of
                    learners, like Japanese, or French. So I figured, what if I could achieve the same level of
                    "language ability" in isiZulu as i did with
                    Japanese?
                </p>

                <p>And so began my journey to accumulate as many resources as I can to learn as much isiZulu as
                    possible. But, I couldn't just
                    hoard everything I've learnt to myself could I? No! I must share it with the WORLD! on this site.
                    I've begun learning web development
                    so i figured I could put theory to practice by building a site myself! I consider myself very much a
                    beginner in both web dev and isiZulu,
                    so consider everything on this site, a working progress:)
                    <br/>
                    With that said, feel free to use these resources as you wish:)
